Though HTMl is not new for me but it was quite fun exercise. I learned more new terminologies through the project. I learned terminologies such as figure tag and figcaption, academic semantic for writing blogs, website contents. Though it was bit difficult to pick up figcaption but with practice it was ok. I figured out I had bit difficulty in visualizing the things. But for that I would constantly check the mockup designs and work accordingly. I did use paper pen to draw the designs to get sense of visualization.
